			Hey, where'd my water go? 

			Hi there! I’m Swampy, and I need your help! Due to tons of trash clogging it, my pipe system has dried up... I can't enjoy my shower! I mean, sure, there are *other* sources of water, but I can't bathe in that! The water's dirty and has many water-borne diseases in it. No matter, we'll solve it together, just like always! You know what isn't as easy to solve?

			<p><img id="waterscarce" src="Images/water scarcity.jpg" alt="people suffering water scarcity">
				Water scarcity is a pressing global issue that affects billions of people around the world. Defined as the lack of sufficient freshwater resources to meet the demands of water usage, it is driven by a combination of factors including population growth, urbanization, climate change, and pollution. According to the United Nations, approximately 2 billion people currently live in countries experiencing high water stress, and this number is expected to rise as demand for water continues to outpace supply. In many regions, agriculture, which accounts for about 70% of global freshwater use, faces significant challenges due to dwindling water supplies, leading to food insecurity and economic instability.
			</p>

			<p>
			The consequences of water scarcity extend beyond just availability; they also impact health, education, and economic development. Limited access to clean water contributes to the spread of waterborne diseases, which disproportionately affect vulnerable populations, particularly children. Additionally, communities without reliable water sources often face challenges in education, as children—especially girls—are required to spend hours fetching water instead of attending school. Addressing water scarcity requires urgent action, including sustainable water management practices, investment in infrastructure, and global cooperation to ensure that everyone has access to this essential resource. As we face the growing impacts of climate change and increasing water demands, finding solutions to this critical issue has never been more vital for ensuring a sustainable future for all.
