			Hey, where'd my water go? 

			Hi there! Iâ€™m Swampy, and I need your help! Due to tons of trash clogging it, my pipe system has dried up... I can't enjoy my shower! I mean, sure, there are *other* sources of water, but I can't bathe in that! The water's dirty and has many water-borne diseases in it. No matter, we'll solve it together, just like always! You know what isn't as easy to solve?

			<p><img id="waterscarce" src="Images/water scarcity.jpg" alt="people suffering water scarcity">
				Water scarcity is a growing global issue affecting millions of people, and solving this issue belongs to SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation). It occurs when the demand for freshwater exceeds the available supply, often due to factors like population growth, climate change, and inefficient water management. Some regions experience physical water scarcity, where natural water sources are insufficient, while others face economic water scarcity, where infrastructure and resources are lacking to provide clean water. This issue is particularly severe in arid and semi-arid regions, where rainfall is minimal, and groundwater is overused. Without sustainable water management, water shortages can threaten food production, public health, and economic stability. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Several factors contribute to water scarcity, including climate change, pollution, and poor governance. Rising global temperatures lead to increased evaporation and unpredictable rainfall patterns, reducing the reliability of water sources. Pollution from industries and agriculture contaminates freshwater supplies, making them unsafe for consumption. Additionally, inefficient irrigation practices in agriculture, which accounts for about 70% of global freshwater use, waste significant amounts of water. To combat water scarcity, solutions like desalination, rainwater harvesting, and water conservation initiatives are being developed. However, global cooperation and responsible water usage are essential to ensuring a sustainable future for all.
