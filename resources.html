                <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/threats/water-scarcity">World Wildlife Org: Water Scarcity</a>
                <p>"...Freshwater is extremely scarce, with only 3% of Earth's water being fresh, much of it locked in glaciers. Currently, 1.1 billion people lack access to water, and 2.7 billion experience seasonal scarcity. Major contributors to this crisis include climate change, pollution, inefficient agricultural practices, and population growth. These factors lead to severe impacts such as inadequate sanitation, loss of wetlands, and ecosystem damage. The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) advocates for better water management and promotes sustainable practices to address these challenges."</p>

            <li>
                <a href="https://www.unicef.org/wash/water-scarcity">UNICEF: Water scarcity</a>
                <p>"...Water scarcity affects nearly two-thirds of the global population, with 4 billion people experiencing severe shortages at least once a year. This crisis, driven by climate change and poor management, disproportionately impacts women and children, who often bear the burden of water collection. UNICEF addresses this issue by improving water resource efficiency, identifying new sources, and promoting climate-resilient technologies. They also focus on raising awareness about water conservation in communities and schools."</p>

                <a href="https://www.unicef.org/reports/reimagining-wash-water-security-for-all">Reimagining WASH (Water Security for All)</a>
                <p>...This document outlines what drives water insecurity, the impact on children, and the actions we need to take now to achieve water security for all.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <a href="https://www.unicef.org/documents/programmatic-approaches-water-scarcity">Programatic Approaches to Water Scarcity</a>
                <p>"One of the attached documents from the previous links. This Guidance Note explores the drivers of water scarcity, and outlines programme principles and programmatic actions to guide WASH programming to help ensure water security for children and their families, with suggested actions at global, regional, national and local levels. Underlying this is the understanding that programmes can no longer continue as ‘business as usual’; urgent interventions are required, creating opportunities to react to changing contexts and to adapt programming at different levels."</p>

            <li>
                <a href="https://www.unicef.org/reports/thirsting-future">Thirsting for a Future</a>
                <p>"...Climate change is one of many forces contributing to an unfolding water crisis. In the coming years, the demand for water will increase as food production grows, populations grow and move, industries develop and consumption increases. This can lead to water stress, as increasing demand and use of water strain available supplies. One of the most effective ways to protect children in the face of climate change is to safeguard their access to safe water and sanitation. This report shares a series of solutions, policy responses and case studies from UNICEF’s work around the world."</p>
